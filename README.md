# Global Child ART Insights ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/868d3eee-0ac4-4965-b896-cac4dd3beb53)

This interactive Tableau dashboard provides a detailed overview of the implementation status of policies on antiretroviral therapy (ART) pick-up and clinic visits for children established on ART, ART pick-up frequencies, and clinic visit frequencies across countries. The dashboard allows users to explore and analyze how policies are implemented and how ART and clinic visits are managed in different regions and countries. Users can switch between **map** and **bar chart** views to gain insights into policy implementation and child ART-related data.

## Data

This dashboard uses global data to visualize the implementation and status of **ART pick-up frequency** and **clinic visit frequency** policies. The data includes country-level and regional-level information on policy status, frequency, and implementation.

## Features

### Global and Regional Views:
- **Global View**: Displays world maps and bar charts for the **policy status**, **frequency of ART pick-up**, and **frequency of clinic visits** policies across all countries.
- **Regional View**: Displays world maps and bar charts for the **policy status**, **frequency of ART pick-up**, and **frequency of clinic visits** policies across regions.

### Maps:
1. **Policy Implementation Status Map**: 
   - Displays a world map showing the status of countries with respect to the **frequency of ART pick-up for children established on ART** and the **frequency of clinic visits for children established on ART** policies, as well as the implementation of both policies in each respective country.
   - Countries are colour-coded based on the policy status (both policies in place, one policy in place, no policy, or no data).
   
2. **Frequency of ART Pick-Up Map**: 
   - Shows a world map where countries are colour-coded based on the frequency of ART pick-up for children established on ART.
   
3. **Frequency of Clinic Visits Map**: 
   - Displays a world map showing the frequency of clinic visits for children established on ART, with colour-coding based on frequency.

### Bar Charts:
1. **Policy Status Bar Chart**: 
   - Displays a bar chart showing the number of countries falling into each category of **policy status** (both policies, one policy, no policy, or no data).
   
2. **ART Pick-Up Frequency Bar Chart**: 
   - A bar chart that shows the number of countries by the **frequency of ART pick-up for children established on ART**.
   
3. **Clinic Visit Frequency Bar Chart**: 
   - A bar chart showing the number of countries by the **frequency of clinic visits for children established on ART**.

### Filters and Search:
- Users can **search by country** across all maps and charts to zoom into a specific country.
- **Filters** are available to search by:
  - **Policy Implementation Status**: Filters maps and charts for countries with specific policy statuses.
  - **Frequency of ART Pick-Up**: Filters maps and charts based on the ART pick-up frequency.
  - **Frequency of Clinic Visits**: Filters maps and charts based on clinic visit frequency.

### Navigation:
- There are **two navigation buttons** at the top of the dashboard, allowing users to toggle between **Global View** and **Regional View**.
- There are **two navigation buttons** on the dashboard, allowing users to toggle between **Map View** and **Chart View**.

## Policies Visualized

1. **Policy on the Frequency of ART Pick-Up**: The frequency at which countries require ART medication to be picked up.
2. **Policy on the Frequency of Clinic Visits**: The frequency at which countries require children established on ART to visit clinics for follow-ups.

### Map and Chart Categories:

- **Policy Status**: 
  - **Both Policies In Place**: Countries with both ART pick-up and clinic visit frequency policies.
  - **One Policy In Place**: Countries with only one of two the policies in place.
  - **No Policy**: Countries with neither policy in place.
  - **No Data**: Countries with no data.

- **Frequency of ART Pick-Up**:
  - Countries colour-coded based on how frequently ART is required to be picked up (e.g., every month, every 2 months, etc.).
  
- **Frequency of Clinic Visits**:
  - Countries colour-coded based on the frequency of required clinic visits (e.g., every month, every 2 months, etc.).

## How to Use

1. **View Toggle**: Use the **Global View** or **Regional View** toggle buttons to switch between global and regional perspectives.
2. **Maps**:
   - Filter and select by **country** or **region** to update the maps based on your preferences.
   - Hover over countries on the maps to view details on policy implementation status, frequency of ART pick-up, and frequency of clinic visits.
3. **Bar Charts**:
   - Filter and select by **country** or **region** to update the bar charts based on your preferences.
   - Use the filter options to adjust data based on **policy implementation status**, **frequency of ART pick-up**, and **frequency of clinic visits**.
